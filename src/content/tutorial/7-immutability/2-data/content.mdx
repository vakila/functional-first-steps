## Immutable Data with Immer.js 


Using _immutable_ aka _persistent_ data structures (note: these terms are technically slightly different, but are often used interchangeably) make writing functional, non-mutating code more efficient, by using _structural sharing_ to reuse unchanged parts of the original data structure. 

Several libraries exist implementing immutable data structures in JavaScript (see links in the further reading section). [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) is a popular choice, so let's take a look at how it works.

### Using Immer.js

Immer lets us work with the regular _mutating_ array methods just like in imperative JS, but _without_ actually changing anything in-place! Instead of calling a method on the array directly, we wrap the array operation in Immer's `produce` function, which as the name suggests will "produce" a new array. 

```js
const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = produce(oldArray, draft => {
    draft.push(4);
});
```

The `produce` function takes in the array to manipulate, along with a callback function. Inside the callback, we can use the regular JS Array API to modify the values of the `draft` array copy, without worrying about messing up the original - Immer takes care of that for us! The `produce` function will use the callback to compute and then return ("produce") the updated `draft`. 

We can also use `produce` to manipulate objects in the same way.

Take a look at how `produce` is called in `immer.test.js` to get a feel for how its API works. You can also refer to the [Immer docs](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) directly.



## Immer-ize the Array operation functions

In `immer.js`, re-implement the `push`, `update` and `pop` functions using `produce`. Make sure the tests in `immer.test.js` are passing.
